## THIS IS A HOME AUTOMATION PROJECT
Home automation controls electronic devices in your home. These devices are connected to the Internet, which allows them to be controlled remotely. With this project, devices can trigger one another so you donâ€™t have to control them manually, but it involves the use of a web browser to control the devices.

In the project, you recieve an email alert when a specific action occurs.
